Assume array size is 9 .swhat if there is a array requirement to change the length (size). For Example, 

If there is a situation where only 5 elements are needed to be entered in this array. In this case, the remaining 4 indices are just wasting memory in this array. So there is a requirement to lessen the length (size) of the array from 9 to 5.
Take another situation. In this, there is an array of 9 elements with all 9 indices filled. But there is a need to enter 3 more elements in this array. In this case, 3 indices more are required. So the length (size) of the array needs to be changed from 9 to 12.
This procedure is referred to as Dynamic Memory Allocation in C.
Therefore, C Dynamic Memory Allocation can be defined as a procedure in which the size of a data structure (like Array) is changed during the runtime.
C provides some functions to achieve these tasks. There are 4 library functions provided by C defined under <stdlib.h> header file to facilitate dynamic memory allocation in C programming. They are: 

malloc()
calloc()
free()
realloc()


The “malloc” or “memory allocation” method in C is used to dynamically allocate a single large block of memory with the specified size. It returns a pointer of type void which can be cast into a pointer of any form. It doesn’t Initialize memory at execution time so that it has initialized each block with the default garbage value initially.

Syntax:
ptr = (cast-type*) malloc(byte-size)
example
ptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int));

Since the size of int is 4 bytes, this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory. And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.
If space is insufficient, allocation fails and returns a NULL pointer

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main()
{
 
    // This pointer will hold the
    // base address of the block created
    int* ptr;
    int n, i;
 
    // Get the number of elements for the array
    printf("Enter number of elements:");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Entered number of elements: %d\n", n);
 
    // Dynamically allocate memory using malloc()
    ptr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
 
    // Check if the memory has been successfully
    // allocated by malloc or not
    if (ptr == NULL) {
        printf("Memory not allocated.\n");
        exit(0);
    }
    else {
 
        // Memory has been successfully allocated
        printf("Memory successfully allocated using malloc.\n");
 
        // Get the elements of the array
        for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ptr[i] = i + 1;
        }
 
        // Print the elements of the array
        printf("The elements of the array are: ");
        for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            printf("%d, ", ptr[i]);
        }
    }
 
    return 0;
}

Enter number of elements: 5
Memory successfully allocated using malloc.
The elements of the array are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
